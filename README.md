# Galton
A 3D printable Galton board.

This project was made using [CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Besides the 3D printed board, here is your shopping list:

- [500 size 8 half inch sequin pins](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XMWZQK4/)
- [10,000 1 millimeter diameter steel balls](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098SZFMRD)
- [#2 1/2 inch round head wood screws](https://www.menards.com/main/hardware/fasteners-connectors/screws/wood-screws/midwest-fastener-reg-2-slotted-drive-brass-round-head-wood-screws/81363/p-1444440031197-c-8940.htm?tid=-4173749362885105444&ipos=2)
- [an acryllic sheet](https://www.menards.com/main/doors-windows-millwork/acrylic-glass-sheets/amerilux-0-060-thick-non-glare-acrylic-sheets/nga8x10x050/p-1539107081822-c-7551.htm)

The pins are usually available at craft stores, and hardware stores have cheap acrylic sheets. The steel balls probably have to come from the internet.
